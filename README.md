## TestingTricks

Dedicated to things around testing.

### SelfTestingAssembly

Demonstrates two things:

    1.  How to embed tests in the same assembly as the code, but without
        making the tests public, yet still recognisable by NUnit.

    2.  How this trick can also be used to test private methods avoiding
        reflection and other nastiness.
